# Huffman Encoding and Decoding with Priority Queue and Tree

This Java program implements Huffman encoding and decoding using a priority queue and a tree-based approach. Huffman coding is a compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies, with shorter codes for more frequent characters.

## Features

- **Huffman Tree Construction**: Build a Huffman tree based on the frequency of characters in the input message.
- **Code Table Generation**: Create a code table mapping characters to their Huffman codes.
- **Message Encoding**: Encode the input message using the generated Huffman codes.
- **Message Decoding**: Decode the encoded message back to the original input.

## Usage

1. **Input Message**: Enter the message to be encoded and decoded when prompted.

2. **Huffman Tree Display**: View the constructed Huffman tree and the code table.

3. **Encoded Message**: See the encoded message generated by Huffman coding.

4. **Decoded Message**: Observe the decoded message, verifying the accuracy of the encoding and decoding process.

## Sample Code

```java
public class HuffmanMain {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the message: ");
        String message = scanner.nextLine();
        scanner.close();

        Huffman huffman = new Huffman();

        Tree realHuffmanTree = huffman.buildHuffmanTree(message);
        System.out.println("Huffman Tree:");
        realHuffmanTree.print();

        String[] codeTable = new String[128];
        huffman.createCodeTable(realHuffmanTree.root, "", codeTable);
        System.out.println("Code Table:");
        huffman.printCodeTable(codeTable);

        String encodedMessage = huffman.encodeMessage(message, codeTable);
        System.out.println("Encoded Message:");
        System.out.println(encodedMessage);

        String decodedMessage = huffman.decodeMessage(encodedMessage, codeTable);
        System.out.println("Decoded Message:");
        System.out.println(decodedMessage);
    }
}
```

## Class Structure

- `Huffman`: Main class responsible for Huffman encoding and decoding.
  - `Node`: Inner class representing a node in the Huffman tree.
  - `Tree`: Inner class representing a Huffman tree.
  - `PriorityQ`: Priority queue implementation for Huffman tree nodes.

## Note

This program utilizes an array-based priority queue (`PriorityQ`) to efficiently construct the Huffman tree. The code table is used to map characters to their corresponding Huffman codes, facilitating message encoding and decoding.
